# ClassificationModelNN
Several Neural Network Model which can classify picture inputted with Matlab 

This project can implement MLP with back-propagation training algorithm (the generalized delta rule) and hybrid model of RBF network,
where the RBF centers are the prototypes from unsupervised competitive learning ( k-means clustering and SOM). 

In the following, RBF1 denote the model with centers from k-means, and RBF2 denote the model with centers from SOM.
